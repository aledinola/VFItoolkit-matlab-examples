% Example based on Guerrieri & Lorenzoni (2017) - Credit Crises, Precautionary Savings, and the Liquidity Trap
% It computes the initial equilibrium, the final equilibrium, the flexible
% price (baseline) transition, and the sticky-wage (New-Keynesian) transition.
% It reproduces most of Figures 1 to 8 of the original paper.
% For details of the model itself, see the original paper: https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/qjecon/v132y2017i3p1427-1467..html
%
% Note: The values of the parameters reported in Table 1 GL2017 paper are not the actual parameters. 
% The values in this example are instead taken from their codes. See the replication for full explanation.
%
% Relatedly, the GL2017 code imports an 'income_process.mat'. To avoid this
% dependency I here use Tauchen method with hyperparameter q=2.1 which
% gives almost the exact same grid and transition for the exogenous shock process on z.
% [I believe their income_process.mat was a Tauchen-Hussey discretization,
% which is much the same for 13 points as Tauchen with hyperparameter q=2.1]

%% To translate Guerrieri & Lorenzoni (2017) into the standard setup of VFI Toolkit I use following:
% d variables: n_it
% aprime variables: b_it+1
% a variables: b_it
% z variables: theta_it, e_it

%% Number of grid points
n_d=51; % Endogenous labor 
n_a=801; % Assets
n_theta=13;

%% Parameters
% (mostly from G&L2017, Table 1)
Params.beta=0.9774; %Model period is one-quarter of a year.

Params.gamma=4; % Coefficient of relative risk aversion
Params.eta=1.5; % Curvature of utility from leisure
Params.psi=15.8819; % Coefficient on leisure in utility

Params.pi_eu=0.0573; % Transition to unemployment (the last three comes from their code, not paper)
Params.pi_ue=0.882; % Transition to employment
% Note: you cannot change pi_eu or pi_ue without changing the return
% function because the implied uncondtional probability of being unemployed
% is hard coded there.
Params.rho=0.967; % Persistence of productivity shock (G&L2017 call this rho)
Params.sigmasq_epsilon=0.017; % Variance of the shock to the log-AR(1) process on labour productivity.
Params.tauchenq=2.1; % I have reverse engineered this value from the grid of GL2017 (copy of their grid is included in their codes). They themselves reverse engineered choice of roughly 2.1 so that the variance of the resulting process (variance of 12-state markov logz) is as close as possible to what it should be (variance of true AR(1) logz).
% This choice of tauchenq is crucial to the results/replication of GL2017. It means
% that the min and max productivity shocks in the model, while they have the correct variance, have a range which
% is roughly just +-standard deviation. Because this range of shocks is so (empirically unrealistically) small
% the equilibrium interest rate is higher than it would otherwise be; if you use tauchenq=3 the zero-lower bound 
% on interest rates in the 'new-keynesian sticky-wage' transition lasts for decades.
% (See 'Comment' on blog at vfitoolkit.com: http://www.vfitoolkit.com/updates-blog/2020/transition-paths-example-based-on-guerrieri-lorenzoni-2017/ )

Params.v=0.1670; % Unemployment benefit
Params.B=2.6712; % Bond supply
Params.Bprime=Params.B; % Bond supply is unchanging (for most of the paper); this is needed as it is part of government budget constraint that determines lump-sum tax tau_t. (Obviously B=Bprime must hold in any stationary general eqm.)
% For creating graphs later it will be useful to store both the initial and final values of phi
Params.phi_initial=1.6005;
Params.phi_final=0.8767;
Params.phi=Params.phi_initial; % Borrowing limit

Params.r=0.006; % General equilibrium interest rate (I use this instead of q). This is just an initial guess. [Model is quarterly, so this corresponds to roughly 2.4% (=4*r) at an annual rate. (Ignoring compounding.)]
% Params.tau % Lump-sum taxes, determined in general equilibrium (I implement it directly inside the ReturnFn)

Params.omega=0; % This is not actually needed for anything until we get to the 'Sticky Wage' model (Section 4 of GL2017, pg 1450)
% In the New Keynesian Sticky Wages model this appears as a wedge that
% increases the utility of leisure (intended to capture a fall in labor
% demand as a result of wages not falling). See GL2017 for explanation.

%% Create the grid for exogenous shocks z, and the transition matrix for these (using Tauchen method)

    pistar_z=pi_z'*pistar_z; % Formula could be used to find stationary dist of the employment unemployment process, then just combine with stationary dist of theta1, which is already calculated
end

z_grid=z_grid/sum(z_grid.*pistar_z);
% Double-check that this is 1
% sum(z_grid.*pistar_z)

% That the "normalized to 1" refers to E[theta] and not E[n*theta] is clear from setting
% v=0.1 to satisfy "For the unemployment benefit, we also follow Shimer
% (2005) and set it to 40% of average labor income." (pg 1438)
% Note, they do not actually ever normalize to 1 in the codes, GL2017 has E[theta]=1.0718


%% Grids
% Set grid for asset holdings
Params.alowerbar=-1.25*Params.phi; % This seems reasonable (No-one can go below -Params.phi in any case). Note that Fischer deflation experiment (second last part of paper) won't work unless this is below -1.1*phi
Params.aupperbar=20; % Not clear exactly what value is appropriate, have gone with this, and checked that increasing it makes no difference.
a_grid=(Params.aupperbar-Params.alowerbar)*(1/(exp(1)-1))*(exp(linspace(0,1,n_a)')-1)+Params.alowerbar;
% GL2017 codes use alowerbar of -2 and aupperbar of 50, but since no-one
% goes anywhere near 50 this seems excessive (even for them 0.9995 of population ends up below 20.8690). 

%Bring model into the notational conventions used by the toolkit
d_grid=linspace(0,1,n_d)'; % Labor supply

n_z=n_theta;

%Create descriptions of SS values as functions of d_grid, a_grid, s_grid &
%pi_s (used to calculate the integral across the SS dist fn of whatever
%functions you define here)
FnsToEvaluate.A = @(d, aprime,a,z) a; % Aggregate assets (which is this periods state)

%Now define the functions for the General Equilibrium conditions
    %Should be written as LHS of general eqm eqn minus RHS, so that 
    %the closer the value given by the function is to zero, the closer 
    %the general eqm condition is to holding.

% the distribution of agents at each time period, this figure requires
% following individuals along the transition path based on where they
% started. Hence will use SimPanelValues_TransPath_Case1() rather than
% EvalFnOnTransPath_AggVars_Case1(); actually the later could/should also be used
% here, but want to show the different options available as part of VFI Toolkit.

% For each of the four transition paths simulate 100 paths drawing from the relevant initial percentile, then take mean.

%% Sticky Wages
% What GL2017 refer to as sticky wages actually enters the model as an increase in
% the utility of leisure. (They justify this as decreasing hours worked
% without decreasing the actual real-age-per-unit-of-time-worked which is
% intended to capture a decrease in labour demand by (unmodelled) firms.)

% Only two changes: first is that the return function needs to be modified
% for this by including omega. (This was actually already implemented in baseline for this code, so no further change.)
% Second is general equilibrium conditions, these now need to enforce r>=0
% and determine omega>0 as that which is needed to acheive that r=0 as a general
% eqm outcome, whenever omega=0 would otherwise mean r<0.
% Then compute transition path (omega=0 in initial and final states, so these remain unchanged).
% The key is all in writing the general equilibrium conditions in right way
% so that omega=0, except when this would lead to r<0, and in these cases
% need to pick omega so that r=0.

% We need to give an initial guess for the price path on interest rates and
% omega. Lets just start with the flexible prices general eqm path for
% interest rates, and with omega=0 for all periods as our initial guess.
PricePath0.r=PricePath.r;
PricePath0.omega=zeros(T,1);

% Rewrite the General Eqm conditions as rules for updating the price
% Only change to this is to enforce that will only try to decrease interest rate when r>=0 is satisfied, never when it is less than zero. When r<0
% instead as 0.01 (note that transition path codes will use 0.9*old+0.1*new anyway, so essentially adding 0.001, a tenth of one percentage point, 
% to interest rate)
TransPathGeneralEqmEqns_sticky.updater = @(r,omega,Aprime,Bprime) (r>=0)*(-0.1*(Aprime-Bprime))+(r<0)*(omega>0)*(2*abs(r)+0.0001); % New interest rate is previous minus 0.1 times excess of bonds (I just guessed 0.1 as being pretty conservative, remember that the transition path will anyway do 0.1 new + 0.9 old price when updating at each iteration)
TransPathGeneralEqmEqns_sticky.updateomega = @(r,omega,Bprime) (r<0)*0.001+(r>=0)*(omega>=0.001)*(-0.001); % If r>=0 then send omega towards zero (as in this case it returns max{0,omega-0.005}). r<0 then increase omega (in this case it returns omega+0.005). (Note: the choice of +0.03 in principle will be good or bad depending on the update rule for the transition path; given that weight on old price is 0.9 this will shift omega up by (1-0.9)*0.02 whenever the interest rate is negative)
% Remark: This approach to how to update omega is different from that used
% by GL2017. They instead force the ZLB on the interest rate r, and then use
% omega to ensure that goods markets clear (Y=C; remember this is an
% endowment economy). omega is updated based on how far the model is from
% goods market clearance.
% Remark: The above updating rules took a few attempts to come up with (the r>=0
% constraint is a 'knife-edge' and so it was not trivial to find something
% that settles down rather than 'jump' back and forth between r<0 and r>0).

transpathoptions.GEnewprice=3; 
% Need to explain to transpathoptions how to use the GeneralEqmEqns to
% update the general eqm transition prices (in PricePath).
transpathoptions.GEnewprice3.howtoupdate=... % a row is: GEcondn, price, add, factor
    {'updater','r',1,0.1;... % updater GE condition will be positive if r is too big, so subtract
    'updateomega','omega',1,0.1}; % updateomega GE condition will be positive if r is negative (omega is too small), so add
% Note: the update is essentially new_price=price+factor*add*GEcondn_value-factor*(1-add)*GEcondn_value
% Notice that this adds factor*GEcondn_value when add=1 and subtracts it what add=0

% initial and final equilibria)
